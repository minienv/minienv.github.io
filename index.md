## What is minienv?

minienv is a web application and collection of services (running in containers) that allow you to quickly spin up Docker Compose
environments in the cloud that you can access from the web. This allows you to quickly create and expose multi-container
environments in seconds.

minienv also provides an online editor that allows you to edit source code or data files included in your Docker Compose
environments. This helps make minienv a great tool for learning (or teaching) new programming languages, databases,
or APIs right from your browser.

## Why was minienv created?

Have you ever used [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to learn Javascript or HTML?
How about [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/), [Swift Sandbox](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/), or
[Try Kotlin](https://try.kotlinlang.org/)? These tools are great for learning new programming languages, but what if you
want to learn more than just a programming language or a Javascript framework? What if you wanted to learn how to connect
Node.js to MongoDB, Swift to PostgreSQL, or a Jupyter notebook to Apache Spark?
 
minienv was created to help make it easier to deliver sample applications that connect to databases and other backend
services and APIs. If you are developing these types of sample applications and looking for a way to make them more accessible
to developers Docker Compose and minienv may be able to help!
